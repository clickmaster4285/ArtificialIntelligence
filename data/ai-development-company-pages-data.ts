      },
      {
        question: 'What AI stack do you use for SF projects?',
        answer: 'GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 (for privacy-sensitive or self-hosted requirements). LangGraph for agentic workflows, LangChain for standard chain-based LLM applications. Pinecone or Weaviate for vector storage. PyTorch/TensorFlow for custom ML. FastAPI for serving. MLflow for MLOps. Stack selection is always based on your specific requirements, not on which platform is easiest for us to deliver on.'

This is particularly important for SF startups building proprietary AI capabilities — the IP needs to be clearly yours for investor due diligence and eventual acquisition or IPO scenarios.'

For think tanks and policy organizations: Literature synthesis AI (tools that aggregate and synthesize policy research, government reports, and academic literature for policy analysis), data analysis acceleration (AI tools that help policy analysts work with large government datasets), and content generation (AI-assisted drafting of policy briefs, reports, and legislative analysis). For trade associations: Member engagement AI (personalization tools that surface relevant content and information for each member based on their industry focus), policy monitoring AI (LLM-based tracking of regulatory and legislative developments relevant to the association\'s focus areas), and content automation (AI-assisted generation of newsletters, policy summaries, and member communications).',

Proposal and business development AI: DC government contractors write massive proposals (sometimes thousands of pages) in response to federal RFPs. AI tools that help structure proposal content, identify relevant past performance, generate compliant section drafts, and review proposals against solicitation requirements can dramatically reduce the $1M–$5M annual proposal writing investment at large contractors. Knowledge management for long-term contractors: Organizations that have operated federal contracts for decades have accumulated institutional knowledge in shared drives, email archives, and staff memories.

Predictive maintenance AI that predicts equipment failures before they occur is among the highest-ROI AI investments in any manufacturing context. Detroit\'s assembly plants run equipment that generates rich sensor data: welding robot arm vibration, paint booth environmental controls, press machine tonnage and stroke data, conveyor system motor current, and automated guided vehicle (AGV) performance telemetry. ClickMasters builds predictive maintenance AI for automotive assembly using vibration signature analysis (FFT preprocessing extracts frequency-domain features from 3-axis vibration data at 4,000+ samples/second), thermal imaging anomaly detection (infrared thermal cameras on electrical panels, robotic systems, and high-cycle machinery detect thermal anomalies before they cause failures), and process signature deviation (welding processes, press operations, and assembly torque operations each have characteristic process signatures that deviate from the normal range when equipment is degrading).',
